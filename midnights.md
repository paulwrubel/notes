## Notes and Scores

### General

- The whole album is caked in a deep, melodramtic vocal filter and droning bassline, which ends up quite dour.
- Many songs are just outright slow and sad, and many more are just boring if not sad.
- The lyricism is totally all over the place. Some songs are actually super creative and nice ("High Infidelity", "Would've, Could've, Should've", "Dear Reader") and some are so literal and annoying it feels like getting hit in the head by a book ("Lavender Haze", "Question...?")
- Many, many, **many** songs remind me of Lorde. This album sounds like it was produced just like Pure Heroine

### Songs

Scores are relative to other songs in the album only, not all music in general

| Name                                   | Score | Notes                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lavender Haze                          | 6     | Lyrics are very blunt, otherwise okay and mildly catchy                              |
| Maroon                                 | 5     | Slow and moody                                                                       |
| **Anti-Hero**                          | 8     | Chorus is very catchy: "It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me"                       |
| Snow On The Beach (feat. Lana Del Rey) | 2     | Even slower and moodier, and also boring                                             |
| You're On Your Own, Kid                | 2     | Just boring, basically                                                               |
| Midnight Rain                          | 5     | Also slow, but also catchy. Not bad, just not my jam                                 |
| Question...?                           | 3     | Super literal, in an annoying way. Not catchy at all                                 |
| Vigilante Shit                         | 5     | Neat concept and execution, but a-melodic and forgettable                            |
| **Bejeweled**                          | 7     | One of the few that sounds like a proper "pop" song                                  |
| Labyrinth                              | 4     | Slow AND boring. Ending *almost* redeems it. "You know how scared I am of elevators" |
| **Karma**                              | 9     | Another true "pop" song, but even better! Reveals a strong melody and owns it        |
| Sweet Nothing                          | 5     | Slow, slightly boring, but not terrible                                              |
| Mastermind                             | 5     | Slow, boring, flat                                                                   |
| The Great War                          | 5     | Perfectly okay song, nothing more                                                    |
| Bigger Than The Whole Sky              | 3     | Slow and boring again. sigh                                                          |
| Paris                                  | 5     | Certainly not terrible, a bit "poppy" at least, still not great                      |
| **High Infidelity**                    | 7     | Peak lyricism. Maybe the only "slow" song I like                                     |
| Glitch                                 | 3     | Odd, but not catchy or interesting                                                   |
| **Would've, Could've, Should've**      | 6     | I really like the lyricism in this song, and it's decently catchy if not amazing     |
| **Dear Reader**                       | 6     | Very good closer. Lyricism is also very good here. Slow, so not my jam.              |
